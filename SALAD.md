# Plan Northwestern x salad.nu

[Plan Northwestern](https://www.plan-nu.com), a 4 year course planning tool, and [salad.nu](https://www.salad.nu), a quarter course scheduling tool, will be integrated with each other this fall.

## What's happening?

salad.nu is a super useful tool for planning courses. Andy is graduating and handing off the project to someone who'd like to maintain it going forward.

Plan Northwestern is still being updated and will soon have an optional account system that can allow users to save plans to an account rather than just saving really long URLs if they'd like. With this merge, salad.nu can take advantage of the account system and URL system, allowing for commonly requested features like multiple schedule support.

## What's changing with Plan Northwestern?

For v1.2.0, Plan Northwestern will be getting a bit of a UI design, primarily above and below the search box (the gray buttons above the search box are a bit ugly lol). I'm trying to maximize search results space (especially for smaller computer screens) and also include the upcoming **Accounts** system! This'll be huge—you'll be able to create an account and save your plans to them, allowing you to quickly switch between them as needed and easily access them from all of your devices. There are a few other things changing, but I'll have more info when it's done.

## What's changing with salad.nu?

Once Plan Northwestern completes its update to v1.2.0, the integration will start (and will be released as Plan Northwestern v2.0.0). There will be no downtime—the current version of salad.nu will be accessible until the new version is ready.

You can expect the integrated version to have everything you love about salad.nu, including the easiness of just navigating to the site and being able to see your schedule and search for courses instantly. The schedule view will be similar, each course will still have detailed information (if not more), the map will still be there, and so on. **You won't lose anything, but you will _gain_ a ton of new features, some of which are listed below!**

-   **Multiple schedules**

    If you're like me, you've probably created multiple version's of a schedule for an upcoming quarter by stuffing all of the different courses on one screen and then hoping that you'll remember which belongs with which. Fret no more, because thanks to Plan Northwestern's **URL data storage system**, schedule data will be saved in the URL, making your schedule savable and sharable. You can send the link to a friend so they can view a copy of your schedule, or swap it out with another link to view another schedule of yours.

-   **Sync across your devices**

    With Plan Northwestern v1.2.0, you'll be able to create an account (just by linking an existing Google account) and save up to 5 plans. Using this same system, you'll be able to save up to a certain amount of schedules on the same account. Idk how many yet but maybe like 10? Is that too many? Or too little? Idk you tell me.

-   **Powerful search**

    Plan Northwestern will bring its powerful search functionality to the course schedule. You'll be able to utilize search shortcuts to easily find the courses you're looking for. For example, typing 'cs 111' will bring up 'COMP_SCI 111-0', and typing 'ea 2' will bring up both 'GEN_ENG 205-2' and 'GEN_ENG 206-2'. There are a bunch more shortcuts, and adding new ones is as easy as [creating an issue](https://github.com/dilanx/plan-northwestern/issues) to let me know of your suggestions. The search functionality will be continuously improved on as time goes on and will be structured in a way that makes it as simple yet also function as possible. Here are some upcoming advanced search options:

    -   Search by time frame
    -   Search by instructor
    -   Search by location (maybe lol idk if this one is that useful)

-   **Custom course blocks**

    You'll be able to add custom course cards with a custom description, day, and time to your schedule (probably).

-   **Better calendar exports**

    Export your quarter course schedule from here to your favorite calendar app like Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook.

-   **More course data**

    Thanks to Plan Northwestern's partnership with the Office of the Registrar, I'll be able to add any data that salad.nu is missing (like some missing courses and discussion sections).

-   **Intuitive user interface**

    One of the nice things about salad.nu is that it's very easy to use. There are no plans to take that away. Rather, it'll be even easier to use. With more detailed data available for each course, you'll be able to see which sections you must add to your schedule in conjunction with a specific course (like required discussion sections and labs), just like in CAESAR. With just a few clicks on a single site, you'll have everything ready. No need to reference a bunch of different sites to see which courses require which prereqs or additional sections.

-   **Seamless integration**

    Drag courses from your plan to your schedule, and vice versa.

_All features listed above are tentative and may not be implemented exactly as described here._

## Plan Northwestern and salad.nu are so easy to use right now. Will all of this new stuff make it too complex?

Not at all. A lot of the heavy work will be done for you in the background automatically. Your browser will still remember and load your most recent plan and schedule, and you won't even need an account. If you choose to make an account to save your stuff and access across devices, all you'd have to do is click the "log in" button and sign in with your existing Google account. All of your saved data will appear before your eyes, ready to use right away. You'll just need to use the sites as you normally would. New features that enhance the experience will only be where they're convenient and easy to use.

## I have a good idea for a feature!

Yay! Please let me know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/dilanx/plan-northwestern/issues). I love implementing suggestions (as long as they're good).

## Can I help?

Yes, please. [You can sign up to help beta test the software here.](https://forms.gle/oqcm8q2qvX615Fry9) You'll get access to early versions and will be tasked with using it and finding any bugs and glitches. If you're interested in contributing and have experience with TypeScript and React (and optionally Tailwind CSS), contact me on Instagram or Discord.

## I'd like to talk about this more! How can I reach you?

Feel free to get in touch by messaging me on Instagram at https://instagram.com/dilan4k. Alternatively, you can message me on Discord at Dilan#1000 (you'll need to join the [Northwestern Discord server](https://discord.gg/aERJFBAhyP) first). You're always welcome to ask any questions you have about this project.

## Isn't this kinda ambitious?

No. CS is good. We want to add a simple course review feature to Plan Northwestern too one day. Everything in one place. You'll barely need CAESAR.

## Who will be working on this?

Primarily me (Dilan), but also Andy if he wants!

## Will it be called Plan Northwestern or salad.nu? Or neither?

Idk yet we'll see.

## The logos include generic icons found online, right? Maybe a new logo?

Yes to both.
